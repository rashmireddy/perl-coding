Survivors gathered away from the mass grave that was once a third of their village on Sunday, jostling for aid in an open-air market of sorts. Thousands congregated around neatly stacked boxes of blankets, mats, oil and flour as elders shouted from makeshift platforms, orchestrating the delivery of the badly needed goods.

But Burhanuddin had no time for that. Along the base of this picturesque valley, where a massive chunk of earth cleaved from a neighboring mountain cascaded onto his and nearly 300 other homes on Friday, he was digging.

His hands were bruised and swollen, and his eyes brimmed with tears. With his battered shovel, he had gouged a roughly 10-foot hole above the spot where he believed his family had been interred in a sudden grave.

“I know they are all dead — my wife, my two sons and my daughter,” said Burhanuddin, 56, who goes by a single name. “I know it is just a waste of time, but my heart doesn’t stop. It keeps telling me to dig more and try harder. ”
